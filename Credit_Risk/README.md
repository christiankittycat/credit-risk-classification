Credit Risk Analysis with Logistic Regression

In this project, we built and evaluated a logistic regression model to predict the likelihood of loan defaults. The dataset used contains various features related to loans, such as borrower characteristics and financial data, with the target variable indicating whether a loan is at high risk of default. We first loaded the data into a Pandas DataFrame and then split it into features (X) and labels (y). The dataset was further divided into training and testing sets to evaluate the model’s performance effectively.

Using the training data, we created a logistic regression model, which is well-suited for binary classification tasks like this one. After fitting the model, we made predictions on the test data to assess how well the model performed. The model’s effectiveness was evaluated using a confusion matrix and a classification report, which provided detailed insights into its accuracy, precision, and recall. These metrics helped us understand how well the model could predict both healthy and high-risk loans.

Overall, the logistic regression model showed strong performance in predicting healthy loans but had some challenges in accurately identifying high-risk loans. This is a common issue, particularly with imbalanced datasets where one class is more prevalent. The results suggest that while the model is reliable, there may be opportunities for further improvement, such as fine-tuning the model or exploring additional features to enhance its ability to detect high-risk loans. This analysis provides a solid foundation for making informed decisions about loan approvals and managing credit risk.
